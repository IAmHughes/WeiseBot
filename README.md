This bot was a fun project to demonstrate to myself competency in completing a project from start to finish, overall scope of a project, utilizing Twitter's Tweepy API for the first time, and my first complete Python project.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

The "covert.py" file that is listed here is just an empty shell. You would need to modify this file using your own API Keys and Customer Keys which can be found by creating your app at apps.twitter.com.

Additionally, Tweepy documentation can be found here: tweepy.readthedocs.org

Thank you for any feedback you may have.
